For PWA icons, you can add these files to the public folder:
- icon-192.png (192x192 pixels)
- icon-512.png (512x512 pixels)

These are referenced in vite.config.js. You can create simple icons or use any image editing tool.
For now, the app will work without these icons, but they enhance the PWA experience.
